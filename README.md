**Loglib is a web analytics tool that can be attached to your app. It's a privacy-first, have beautiful dashbaord and built for js frameworks ecosystem and it's open source.**

### Why Loglib

- Why not?
- No need to deploy it separately. You can easily attach Loglib to your Next js app (more framework support soon), and you can see your website analytics. (despite having 0 users)
- Keep all your data in your existing database, you have the freedom to store your data in your existing db or your choice of db. We currently support prisma and supabase adapters but more supports are on the way.
- Behold the beauty of your dashboard, powered by Shadcn UI.
- Privacy-first and GDPR compliant out of the box, with customization options.
- You can see basic analytics like vercel analytics but also events aren't paid and it's better than...
- Your mom will be impressed.
- And more things are on the way.

### Adding loglib to Next JS ðŸ”¥

#### Install like every other library

```bash
pnpm add @loglib/next
```

loglib ships with a cli tool that helps you setup your project. You can run the following command to setup your project and watch as the magic unfolds:

```bash
pnpm loglib init
```

To update all the loglib packages in your app, you can run the following command:

```bash
pnpm loglib update
```

this will setup your project with all possible configurations. Refer to the [docs](#docs) for more information.

### Other Frameworks / Separate Deployments

1. clone <https://github.com/LogLib/loglib-starter> this repo and run `pnpm i` to install dependencies.
2. change .env.example to .env and fill in the required env variables
3. migrate your database with `pnpm prisma migrate` or `pnpm prisma db push`
4. You can now deploy but if you're deploying to platforms other than vercel you need to setup location resolver for your server. [Read more](https://github.com/loglib/loglib/#resolving-user-location-from-ip)
5. Now go to your project where you want to track and put loglib url in the `LOGLIB_URL` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGLIB_URL` env variable.
6. Install the loglib tracker in `pnpm i @loglib/tracker`
7. Follow the instructions in the [doc](https://github.com/LogLib/loglib#loglib-tracker) to setup the tracker.

## Get Started

### Next JS With Prisma

1. **Install like every other library**

```bash
pnpm i @loglib/tracker @loglib/next @loglib/prisma-adapter @loglib/ui
```

2. **Copy the following schema to your prisma schema file**

**Relational DB**

```prisma

    WebSession WebSession  @relation(fields: [sessionId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

    @@map("web_event")
}
```

3. **Let's setup the server**

**App Route**

create a file `app/api/loglib/route.ts`

```ts
import { createServerRoutes } from "@loglib/next";
import { prismaAdapter } from "@loglib/prisma-adapter";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const db = new PrismaClient();

export const { POST, GET } = createServerRoutes({
  adapter: prismaAdapter(db),
});
```

**Pages Route**

put this code in `src/pages/api/loglib.ts`

```js
import { createServer } from "@loglib/next";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import { prismaAdapter } from "@loglib/prisma-adapter";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

export default createServer({
  adapter: prismaAdapter(prisma),
});
```

> NOTE: If you want to change the default path of loglib server you can add LOGLIB_URL in your environment variables specifying the full path to your loglib server api url.

4. **Let's setup Dashboard to see our analytics. (yeah not ours it's yours)**

Create a page somewhere you want to see your dashboard and just export the dashboard component

`app/analytics/page.tsx` or `pages/analytics.tsx`

```ts
"use client"; // App Route Only

import { Dashboard } from "@loglib/ui";
import "@loglib/ui/dist/index.css";

export default Dashboard;
```

> NOTE: you probably want to protect this route with some kind of authentication. Either by using a middleware or export the dashboard component inside a protected route.

5. **Let's setup the tracker to collect analytics**

`src/app/layout.tsx`

```ts
import LogLib from "@loglib/tracker/react";
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <LogLib
          config={
            {
              //  your config here
            }
          }
        />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### Next JS With Supabase

1. **Install like every other library**

```bash
pnpm i @loglib/tracker @loglib/next @loglib/supabase-adapter @loglib/ui
```

2. **Copy the following to supabase sql editor and run it**

```sql
create table if not exists
  public.web_user (
    id text not null,
    data text not null default '{}'::text,
    created_at timestamp without time zone not null default current_timestamp,
    updated_at timestamp without time zone not null,
    constraint web_user_pkey primary key (id)
  ) tablespace pg_default;

create table if not exists
  public.web_session (
    id text not null,
    created_at timestamp with time zone not null,
    updated_at timestamp with time zone not null,
    referrer text not null default ''::text,
    query_params text not null default ''::text,
    duration integer not null default 0,
    country text null,
    city text null,
    device text null,
    os text null,
    browser text null,
    language text null,
    user_id text not null,
    constraint web_session_pkey primary key (id),
    constraint web_session_user_id_fkey foreign key (user_id) references web_user (id) on update cascade on delete cascade
  ) tablespace pg_default;

create table if not exists
  public.web_pageview (
    id text not null,
    created_at timestamp without time zone not null default current_timestamp,
    updated_at timestamp without time zone not null,
    page text not null,
    referrer text not null default ''::text,
    query_params text not null default ''::text,
    duration integer not null default 0,
    session_id text not null,
    user_id text not null,
    constraint web_page_pkey primary key (id),
    constraint web_pageview_session_id_fkey foreign key (session_id) references web_session (id) on delete cascade,
    constraint web_pageview_user_id_fkey foreign key (user_id) references web_user (id) on delete cascade
  ) tablespace pg_default;

create table if not exists
  public.web_event (
    id text not null,
    created_at timestamp without time zone not null default current_timestamp,
    updated_at timestamp without time zone not null,
    event_type text not null,
    event_name text not null,
    payload text not null default ''::text,
    page_id text not null,
    session_id text not null,
    user_id text not null,
    constraint web_event_pkey primary key (id),
    constraint web_event_page_id_fkey foreign key (page_id) references web_pageview (id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
    constraint web_event_session_id_fkey foreign key (session_id) references web_session (id) on delete cascade,
    constraint web_event_user_id_fkey foreign key (user_id) references web_user (id) on update cascade on delete cascade
  ) tablespace pg_default;
```

3. **Let's setup the server**

**App Route**

create a file `app/api/loglib/route.ts`

```ts
import { createServerRoutes } from "@loglib/next";
import { supabaseAdapter } from "@loglib/supabase-adapter";
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.SUPABASE_KEY
);

export const { POST, GET } = createServerRoutes({
  adapter: supabaseAdapter(supabase),
});
```

> NOTE: If you want to change the default path of loglib server you can add LOGLIB_URL in your environment variables specifying the full path to your loglib server api url.

**Pages Route**

put this code in `src/pages/api/loglib.ts`

```ts
import { createServer } from "@loglib/next";
import { supabaseAdapter } from "@loglib/supabase-adapter";
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.SUPABASE_KEY
);

export default createServer({
  adapter: supabaseAdapter(supabase),
});
```

4. **Let's setup Dashboard to see our analytics. (yeah not ours it's yours)**

Create a page somewhere you want to see your dashboard and just export the dashboard component

`app/analytics/page.tsx` or `pages/analytics.tsx`

```ts
"use client"; // Next 13 Only

import { Dashboard } from "@loglib/ui";
import "@loglib/ui/dist/index.css";

export default Dashboard;
```

Now you can navigate to this page and see your analytics. But it will be empty because we haven't setup the tracker yet.

> NOTE: you probably want to protect this route with some kind of authentication. Either by using a middleware or export the dashboard component inside a protected route.

5. **Let's setup the tracker to collect analytics**

**App Route**
`src/app/layout.tsx`

```ts
import LogLib from "@loglib/tracker/react";
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <LogLib
          config={
            {
              //  your config here
            }
          }
        />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

**Pages Route**

```ts
import "../../styles/globals.css";
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
import Loglib from "@loglib/tracker/react";

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <>
      <Loglib
        config={
          {
            //  your config here
          }
        }
      />
      <Component {...pageProps}></Component>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Docs

### Basic Concept

Loglib is consist of three things:

1. **Tracker**: This component tracks your website's analytics.
2. **Loglib Server**: It handles requests without requiring a separate deployment if you already have a backend.
3. **Loglib Dashboard**: It offers a beautiful, minimalistic UI to display your analytics.

The idea is that you can integrate a tracker into your website, similar to other analytics tools. However, instead of sending the data to a third-party server or a separately deployed thing like umami (which we love), it is sent to your current server, which can be set up as an endpoint in your Next.js application (other alternatives in the near future). Then, you can utilize a dashboard that is currently built as a React component (again more frameworks soon). You can export this component as page, enabling you to conveniently view and analyze your website analytics.

### Loglib Tracker

#### Next-js

App Route

`src/app/layout.tsx`

```js
import Loglib from "@loglib/tracker/react";
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode,
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <Loglib
          config={
            {
              //  your config here
            }
          }
        />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Page Route

`src/pages/_app.tsx`

```js
import Loglib from "@loglib/tracker";
export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <>
      <Loglib config={{}} />
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </>
  );
}
```

> IMPORTANT: By default the tracker will send data to the loglib server at the current url on route `/api/loglib` if you need to change that you can put LOGLIB_URL in your environment variables with the full path.

### Other Frameworks

if you're not using next js or react you can use the vanilla version of the tracker that works on any framework just call the record function on the entry point of your application here is example for astro.

```js
<script>
  import {record} from '@loglib/tracker-js'; record(
  {
    // your config here
  })
</script>
```

### CDN

To use loglib via the CDN, simply copy the following code into your script tag and replace the host with your deployed version:

> Note that if you don't want to collect development logs, you can pass the env parameter as isDev(your way to know if it's development server) ? "dev": "prod".

```html
<head>
  <script>
    const r = window.document.createElement("script");
    r.type = "text/javascript";
    r.async = !0;
    r.src =
      "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@loglib/tracker@latest/dist/index.global.js";
    const a = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];
    a.parentNode.insertBefore(r, a);
    r.onload = () => {
      loglib.record({ host: "http://localhost:3000" });
    };
  </script>
</head>
```

### Other Methods

If you want to track a specific event, you can use the `track` method.

```js
import { loglib } from "@loglib/tracker";
export default function page() {
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => loglib.track("search", { term: "iphone" })}>
        Search
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

To identify a user, you can use the `identify` method.
_this doesn't work unless you have a consent from the user. (more on that below)_

```js
import { loglib } from "@logLib/tracker";
export default function page() {
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => loglib.identify({ id: "1", name: "Joe Rogan" })}>
        Identify
      </button>
    </>
  );
}

// Identify we know this is hot topic
// Yeah just pass an object you want to identify the user with
```

### User Concent

By default, Loglib tries to track users using their IP address. But, we know you're smart enough to know relying on IP addresses isn't the most reliable way to identify unique users. So, if you want to track better, here's what you can do:

**Step 1:** Display a fancy cookie message on your website. (we'll leave the design up to you but might provide something in the future)

**Step 2**: Once your users click that "Accept" button, trigger the Loglib consent function. This will use local storage to assign a unique identifier to each of your users.

```js
import { loglib } from "@loglib/tracker";
export default function page() {
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => loglib.setConsent("granted")}>Accept</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

> NOTE: If you don't want to show cookie message, but still want to track using user consent, you can set the consent to "granted" by default.

```js
import LogLib from "@loglib/tracker/react";
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode,
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <LogLib
          config={{
            consent: "granted",
          }}
        />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

| options        | type    | default     | description                                                           |
| -------------- | ------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `autoTrack`    | boolean | `false`     | Automatically track click events with onclick handlers and on buttons |
| `consent`      | string  | `"granted"` | The consent status of the user                                        |
| `debug`        | boolean | `false`     | Enable debug mode                                                     |
| `env`          | string  | `"auto"`    | The environment of the tracker                                        |
| `postInterval` | number  | `5`         | The interval to send events to the server                             |

> NOTE: currently you can't use loglib server or dashboard in other frameworks other than next js or react but you can attach the dashboard on astro since you can use react in astro and we'll provide astro server soon. And you can always deploy a new next js project separated from your main project and use it as a dashboard and a server. See the example folder for more.

### Loglib Server

first you need to setup a database and an adapter for the server to work.

> we currently only support prisma and supabase adapters but more adapters are on the way.

See on [nextjs with supabase](#next-js-with-supabase) or [nextjs with prisma](#next-js-with-prisma) to see how to setup one. Then you need to create a server handler that will handle the requests from the tracker. Also you can see that on the above links.

#### Resolving User Location from IP

for getting user location using their ip you have 3 options:

1. Deploy it in vercel and that's it!
2. If you're not deploying it on serverless environment you can setup maxmind using a cli command

```bash
pnpm loglib setup:maxmind
```

> this will download the maxmind database and put it in your project root directory under geo folder.

3. you can also provide a custom implementation for getting the user location by passing a function to the `getLocation` option.

```ts
import { createServer } from "@loglib/next";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import { prismaAdapter } from "@loglib/prisma-adapter";

const db = new PrismaClient();
const POST = Next13({
  adapter: prismaAdapter(db),
  async getLocation(ip) {
    // do your thing
    return {
      city: "city",
      country: "country",
    };
  },
});
```

4. You can disable location from being resolved by passing `true` to the `disableLocation` option.

```ts
import { createServer } from "@loglib/next";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import { prismaAdapter } from "@loglib/prisma-adapter";

const db = new PrismaClient();

const POST = Next13({
  adapter: prismaAdapter(db),
  disableLocation: true,
});
```

5. You can turn on authentication to guard your both api endpoint and dashboard by passing `secret` to the `auth` option. Make sure to include this environment variables in your .env file to access your dashboard.

`LOGLIB_USERNAME`  
`LOGLIB_PASSWORD`
`LOGLIB_SECRET`

```ts
//generated by loglib
import { prismaAdapter } from "@loglib/prisma-adapter";
import { createServer } from "@loglib/next";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const db = new PrismaClient();

export default createServer({
  adapter: prismaAdapter(db),
  auth: { secret: process.env.LOGLIB_SECRET as string },
});
```

### Loglib Dashboard

You can use the loglib dashboard which is react only right now but there is a plan to support more frameworks in the future.

```bash
pnpm add @loglib/ui
```

then export the dashboard wherever you want in your app.

```js
import { Dashboard } from "@loglib/ui";
import "@loglib/ui/dist/index.css";

export default function page() {
  return (
    <>
      <Dashboard />
    </>
  );
}
```

You probably want to protect the dashboard with some kind of auth check. You can use our custom credential login but you can also use any auth library you want. Here is an example using next auth.

```ts
import { Dashboard } from "@loglib/ui";
import "@loglib/ui/dist/index.css";
import { useSession } from "next-auth/client";

export default function page() {
  const [session, loading] = useSession();
  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (!session) return <div>Access Denied</div>;
  return (
    <>
      <Dashboard />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Updating Loglib

Loglib is always evolving it might not be usual to update libraries in production apps frequently but you might wanna look at loglib a bit different. There will be always new features and fixes so you might wanna update your loglib version from time to time. We'll try to keep the updates as smooth as possible but since we're still in beta there might be breaking changes but we'll try to keep them to a minimum. You can see the changelog for more info.
