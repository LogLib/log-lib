Loglib is a **open source** and **privacy-first** web analytics. Crafted with love by [bekacru](https://twitter.com/imbereket) and [theodore](#)
You might have heared the first sentence before and you're right we're not that different. But we think we're cool which by defination make us not cool but defintely there are some cool things we do. I just said cool 3 times. That's cool.

There are two version of loglib. Loglib the **pacakge versions** which is self hosted and can be embedded in your app. _yep! you can roll your own analytics now let see what twitter says about this._ And Loglib **hosted version** which is where you at now is a full on web analytics that gave you access to use loglib easily and have features like teams and so on.

> We're excited to offer the hosted version for free while we continue to grow our user base. As we expand, we plan to introduce a paid version with a generous free tier. Thank you for being a part of our journey!

## Why Loglib?

- Why not?
- Privacy-first and GDPR compliant out of the box, with customization options.
- You can see basic analytics like vercel analytics but also events aren't paid and it's better than...
- No need to deploy it separately. You can easily attach Loglib to your Next js app (more framework support soon), and you can see your website analytics. (despite having 0 users)
- You can repurpose your data. Either you can use the hosted version api or you can roll your own analytics with the package version of Loglib.
- **Your mom will be impressed.**
- And more cool things are on the way.
