<Callout>
  As said above there are two ways to use Loglib. You can use the hosted version
  or you can use the package version. The package version is more customizable
  and you can use it with your own database. But the hosted version is easier to
  setup and it's **free** for now. The setup below is for the package version.
  If you want to use the hosted version you can go to the
  [dashboard](/dashboard) and create a new project and follow the instructions
  there.

Currently LogLib supports Next JS. But if you want to use LogLib with other
frameworks, you can sill deploy loglib separately and use the tracker in ur
site.

### Install like every other library

```bash
pnpm add @loglib/next
```

loglib ships with a cli tool that helps you setup your project. You can run the following command to setup your project and watch as the magic unfolds:

```bash
pnpm loglib init
```

To update all the loglib packages in your app, you can run the following command:

```bash
pnpm loglib update
```

this will setup your project with all possible configurations. Refer to the [Advanced Docs](/advanced) for more information.

### Other Frameworks / Separate Deployments

1. clone [https://github.com/LogLib/loglib-starter](https://github.com/LogLib/loglib-starter) this repo and run `pnpm i` to install dependencies.
2. change .env.example to .env and fill in the required env variables
3. migrate your database with `pnpm prisma migrate` or `pnpm prisma db push`
4. You can now deploy but if you're deploying to platforms other than vercel you need to setup location resolver for your server. [Read more](https://github.com/loglib/loglib/#resolving-user-location-from-ip)
5. Now go to your project where you want to track and put loglib url in the `LOGLIB_URL` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGLIB_URL` env variable.
6. Install the loglib tracker in `pnpm i @loglib/tracker`
7. Follow the instructions in the [doc](https://github.com/LogLib/loglib#loglib-tracker) to setup the tracker.
