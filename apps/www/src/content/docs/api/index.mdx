title: Loglib Site API
---

One of the reasons loglib was created was because we couldn't find a decent option that allowed us to repurpose the data they collected at the time. Don't get me wrong: they might exist, but we weren't able to find them. So we developed an embeddable one where you can grab your own data from your database, but if you use the site version, either self-deployed or on loglib.io, you lose that ability, so we made sure you can access it through api just like it's in your database.

  The api is designed after prisma find many syntax. So if you're familiar with
  prisma you'll be familiar with this api. if not it's still really easy to
  grasp. And remember all the api calls use POST method.
