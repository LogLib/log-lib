title: Upgrading Loglib
description: How to upgrade loglib
---

Loglib is always evolving it might not be usual to update libraries in production apps frequently but you might wanna look at loglib a bit different.
There will be always new features and fixes so you might wanna update your loglib version from time to time. We'll try to keep the updates as smooth
as possible but since we're still in beta there might be breaking changes but we'll try to keep them to a minimum. You can see the changelog for more info.
