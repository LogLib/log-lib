this is the tracker package for loglib, it's a simple package that you can use to track events in your application.

Start by installing the package

```bash
pnpm i @loglib/tracker
```

## NextJS

usage with nextjs

<Tabs items={["app-route", "pages"]}>
  <Tab value="app-route">
    `src/app/layout.tsx`

    ```ts
    import LogLib from "@loglib/tracker/react";
    export default function RootLayout({
      children,
    }: {
      children: React.ReactNode;
    }) {
      return (
        <html lang="en">
          <body>
            <LogLib
              config={
                {
                  //  your config here
                }
              }
            />
            {children}
          </body>
        </html>
      );
    }
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pages">
    `src/pages/_app.tsx`

    ```js
    import LogLib from "@loglib/tracker";
    export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
      return (
        <>
          <LogLib config={{}} />
          <Component {...pageProps} />
        </>
      );
    }
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

> IMPORTANT: By default the tracker will send data to the loglib server at the current url on route `/api/loglib` if you need to change that you can put LOGLIB_URL in your environment variables with the full path.

## Other Frameworks

if you're not using next js or react you can use the vanilla version of the tracker that works on any framework just call the record function on the entry point of your application here is example for astro.

```js
<script>
  import {loglib} from '@loglib/tracker';
  loglib.record(
  {
    id: "1",
    host: "https://loglib.io",
  })
</script>
```

## CDN

To use loglib via the CDN, simply copy the following code into your script tag and replace the host with your deployed version:

> Note that if you don't want to collect development logs, you can pass the env parameter as isDev(your way to know if it's development server) ? "dev": "prod"

```html
<head>
  <script>
    const r = window.document.createElement("script")
    r.type = "text/javascript"
    r.async = !0
    r.src =
      "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@loglib/tracker@latest/dist/index.global.js"
    const a = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]
    a.parentNode.insertBefore(r, a)
    r.onload = () => {
      loglib.record({ host: "https://loglib.io" })
    }
  </script>
</head>
```

## Other Methods

If you want to track a specific event, you can use the `track` method.

example in nextjs/react app

```js
import { loglib } from "@loglib/tracker"
export default function page() {
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => loglib.track("search", { term: "iphone" })}>
        Search
      </button>
    </>
  )
}
```

To identify a user, you can use the `identify` method.
_this doesn't work unless you have a consent from the user. (more on that below)_

```js
import { loglib } from "@logLib/tracker"
export default function page() {
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => loglib.identify({ id: "1", name: "Joe Rogan" })}>
        Identify
      </button>
    </>
  )
}

// Identify we know this is hot topic
// Yeah just pass an object you want to identify the user with
```

## User Concent

By default, Loglib tries to track users using their IP address. But, we know you're smart enough to know relying on IP addresses isn't the most reliable way to identify unique users. So, if you want to track better, here's what you can do:

<Steps>

    ### Step 1

    Display a fancy cookie message on your website. (we'll leave the design up to you but might provide something in the future)

    ### Step 2

    Once your users click that "Accept" button, trigger the Loglib consent function. This will use local storage to assign a unique identifier to each of your users.

    ```js
    import { loglib } from "@loglib/tracker";
    export default function page() {
      return (
        <>
          <button onClick={() => loglib.setConsent("granted")}>Accept</button>
        </>
      );
    }
    ```

    > NOTE: If you don't want to show cookie message, but still want to track using user consent, you can set the consent to "granted" by default.

    ```js
    import LogLib from "@loglib/tracker/react";
    export default function RootLayout({
      children,
    }: {
      children: React.ReactNode,
    }) {
      return (
        <html lang="en">
          <body>
            <LogLib
              config={{
                consent: "granted",
              }}
            />
            {children}
          </body>
        </html>
      );
    }
    ```

</Steps>

<Callout>
  NOTE: Currently you can't use loglib server or dashboard in other frameworks
  other than next js or react but you can attach the dashboard on astro since
  you can use react in astro and we'll provide astro server soon. And you can
  always deploy a new next js project separated from your main project and use
  it as a dashboard and a server. See the example folder for more.
