title: Next JS Proxy
---

You can use Next.js to route all analytics traffic through your own server and domain. This will reduce DNS lookups, as well as prevent Adblockers from blocking requests.

By default the tracker sends request to your own domain at `/api/loglib`. So remove the host from the tracker code and add a reweite to your Next.js config.

```ts
module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/api/loglib",
        destination: "https://loglib.io/api/loglib",
      },
    ]
  },
}
```
