If you want to track a specific event, you can use the `track` method.

example in nextjs/react app

```js
import { loglib } from "@loglib/tracker"
export default function page() {
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => loglib.track("search", { term: "iphone" })}>
        Search
      </button>
    </>
  )
}
```

  NOTE: Currently you can't use loglib server or dashboard in other frameworks
  other than next js or react but you can attach the dashboard on astro since
  you can use react in astro and we'll provide astro server soon. And you can
  always deploy a new next js project separated from your main project and use
  it as a dashboard and a server. See the example folder for more.
