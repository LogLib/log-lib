If you want to track a specific event, you can use the `track` method.

example in nextjs/react app

```js
import { loglib } from "@loglib/tracker"
export default function page() {
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => loglib.track("search", { term: "iphone" })}>
        Search
      </button>
    </>
  )
}
```


## User Concent

By default, Loglib tries to track users using their IP address. But, we know you're smart enough to know relying on IP addresses isn't the most reliable way to identify unique users. So, if you want to track better, here's what you can do:

<Steps>

    ### Step 1

    Display a fancy cookie message on your website. (we'll leave the design up to you but might provide something in the future)

    ### Step 2

    Once your users click that "Accept" button, trigger the Loglib consent function. This will use local storage to assign a unique identifier to each of your users.

    ```js
    import { loglib } from "@loglib/tracker";
    export default function page() {
      return (
        <>
          <button onClick={() => loglib.setConsent("granted")}>Accept</button>
        </>
      );
    }
    ```

    > NOTE: If you don't want to show cookie message, but still want to track using user consent, you can set the consent to "granted" by default.

    ```js
    import LogLib from "@loglib/tracker/react";
    export default function RootLayout({
      children,
    }: {
      children: React.ReactNode,
    }) {
      return (
        <html lang="en">
          <body>
            <LogLib
              config={{
                consent: "granted",
              }}
            />
            {children}
          </body>
        </html>
      );
    }
    ```

</Steps>

<Callout>
  NOTE: Currently you can't use loglib server or dashboard in other frameworks
  other than next js or react but you can attach the dashboard on astro since
  you can use react in astro and we'll provide astro server soon. And you can
  always deploy a new next js project separated from your main project and use
  it as a dashboard and a server. See the example folder for more.
