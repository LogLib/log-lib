- **Introduced Pricing**: We're excited to announce that loglib now offers subscription [plans](https://loglib.io/pricing). You can now subscribe to one of our paid versions to unlock additional features and show your support for our continued development. You can go to dashboard setting to choose a plan.

- **Migrated to turso**: We've made some changes to improve the ease of using loglib. While we initially used Prisma with Planetscale, we recognized that it wasn't ideal for local development. Our goal is to make loglib accessible to everyone. You no longer need to sign up for external services or deal with complex Docker setups that can slow down your computer. All you need is a basic SQLite database to run loglib on development, and we use Turso for production.

- **Celberations**: We believe in making your loglib experience enjoyable. That's why we've introduced celebrations to our dashboard. It's been about two weeks since this feature was added. You can now celebrate your achievements by simply clicking the "celebrate" button on your dashboard. Additionally, you can set celebration goals, which are automatically triggered once a day when you achieve your goals. We have more exciting developments in the works, so stay tuned for updates.

- **Better Contributing Guid**: We have enhanced our contributing guide to make it straightforward. This guide is designed to help you better understand how to contribute to loglib effectively. You can find it [here](https://github.com/loglib/loglib/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)

- **Changes to Dashboard URLs**: We've made a small change to the website dashboard URLs. Instead of being located at loglib.io/[Your Website Id], they will now be found at loglib.io/s/[Your Website Id].

> NB: As always, if you encounter any issues or have suggestions for LogLib's improvement, please don't hesitate to open an issue on our repository.
